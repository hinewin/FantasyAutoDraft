Key Draft Strategies:
Early rounds: Focus on points and assists since they become scarce early on.
Mid rounds: Target big men for rebounds and blocks, as these categories will dry up quickly after the center runs.
Late rounds: Threes and steals become easier to find; however, pay attention to injury-prone players like Paul George and risky players like Kyrie Irving.
